# About

RbxPackages is a collection of utility modules designed for use by Roblox Developers.

To get started, check out the [installation instructions](/docs/installation) and look through the module documentation in the [API](/API) tab.

I anticipate this to be a fairly small project so at the moment there is no Discord server setup. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me in the [Roblox OSS Community](https://discord.gg/CA86WWncsS) Discord or send an email to [minstrix@mindblast.games](mailto:minstrix@mindblast.games) and I would be happy to help.
