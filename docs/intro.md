# About

Bridge is a [Roblox](https://roblox.com/) game framework. It has three main features; hooks, services, and middleware.

Hooks are used to bind modules to collection service tags. Services are used for easy life cycles and inter-script communication. Middleware is used to simplify client-server remotes.

You can read more about how each of these work by viewing their respective [API](/api) pages.
