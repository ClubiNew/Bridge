# Attributions

My main motivation for releasing these modules was sleitnick's [RbxUtils](https://github.com/Sleitnick/RbxUtil). Some of the packages within this repository make use of them, and I would strongly recommend checking out that collection as well if you need anything that isn't here.

You can see the full list of third-party packages used by checking the `wally.toml` file for each module.
